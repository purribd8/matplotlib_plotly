# Matplotlib_Plotly



This project involves generating and visualizing random data using both Plotly and Matplotlib to explore the outcomes of different simulations. It begins by simulating the rolling of dice (both D6 and D10) and tracking the results over several rolls. The frequency of each roll is calculated and visualized in bar charts using Plotly, which allows for an interactive view of the data. The project also includes a random walk simulation, where a set of random steps is plotted on a 2D grid, using Matplotlib to create scatter plots of the walk's progression. Additionally, the project demonstrates the use of various Matplotlib styling options and scatter plot visualizations to display mathematical relationships, such as the square of values. These different components combine to provide an insightful exploration of random processes through clear and interactive visual representations.
